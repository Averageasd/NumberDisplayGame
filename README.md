Practice project to learn property and event bindings. An event that emits an increasing number every second is located inside the
component GameControl. This eventEmitter is then listened by the parent component which is app component. upon receiving the value of type number emitted by GameControl event emitter, parent will push this number to an array and log it out to the screen. if number is odd, display "Odd-number"; otherwise, display "Even-number".
